	abstract = {We investigate the transverse modes of the gravitational and velocity ﬁelds in Λ{CDM}, based on a high-resolution simulation performed using the adaptive-mesh reﬁnement general-relativistic N -body code {GRAMSES}. We study the generation of vorticity in the dark matter velocity ﬁeld at low redshift, providing ﬁts to the shape and evolution of its power spectrum over a range of scales. By analysing the gravitomagnetic vector potential, which is absent in Newtonian simulations, in dark matter haloes with masses ranging from ∼ 1012.5 h−1M to ∼ 1015 h−1M , we ﬁnd that its magnitude correlates with the halo mass, peaking in the inner regions. Nevertheless, on average, its ratio against the scalar gravitational potential remains fairly constant, below percent level, decreasing roughly linearly with redshift and showing a weak dependence on halo mass. Furthermore, we show that the gravitomagnetic acceleration in haloes peaks towards the core and reaches almost 10−10 h cm/s2 in the most massive halo of the simulation. However, regardless of the halo mass, the ratio between the gravitomagnetic force and the standard gravitational force is typically at around the 10−5 level inside the haloes, again without signiﬁcant radius dependence. This result conﬁrms that the gravitomagnetic effects have negligible impact on structure formation, even for the most massive structures, although its behaviour in low density regions remains to be explored. Likewise, the impact on observations remains to be understood in the future.},

The estimation of the expected performance of the experiment, in terms of predicted constraints on cosmological parameters, has so far relied on various individual methodologies and numerical implementations, which were developed for different observational probes and for the combination thereof. In this paper we present validated forecasts, which combine both theoretical and observational ingredients for different cosmological probes. This work is presented to provide the community with reliable numerical codes and methods for Euclid cosmological forecasts.},

	shorttitle = {Looking for a twist},
	abstract = {General relativity predicts that the rotational momentum ﬂux of matter twists the spacetime via a vector gravitomagnetic (framedragging) ﬁeld, which remains undetected in cosmology. This vector ﬁeld induces an additional gravitational lensing eﬀect; at the same time, the momentum ﬁeld sources the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel’dovich ({kSZ}) eﬀect. The common origin of these two eﬀects allows us to probe the gravitomagnetic signal via their cross-correlations. In this paper, we explore the possibility of detecting the gravitomagnetic ﬁeld in Λ{CDM} by cross-correlating the weak-lensing convergence ﬁeld with the {CMB} temperature map, which is imprinted with the {kSZ} signal. This approach allows us to extract the gravitomagnetic eﬀect because the cross correlation between the standard Newtonian contribution to the weak-lensing convergence ﬁeld, 𝜅Φ, and the {kSZ} eﬀect is expected to vanish. We study the cross correlations with a suite of large-volume Newtonian 𝑁-body simulations and a small-volume, high-resolution, general-relativistic counterpart. We show that insuﬃcient simulation resolution can introduce signiﬁcant spurious correlations between 𝜅Φ and {kSZ}. From the high-resolution simulation, we ﬁnd that the cumulative signal-to-noise ratio ({SNR}) of the {kSZ}-gravitomagnetic convergence ﬁeld can reach almost 15 (30) at ℓ ' 5000 (104) for the lensing source redshift 𝑧𝑠 = 0 83, if only cosmic variance is considered. We make forecast for next-generation lensing surveys such as euclid and lsst, and {CMB} experiments such as Simons Observatory and cmb-s4, and ﬁnd that, for 𝑧𝑠 = 1 4, the cumulative {SNR} can exceed 5 (9) at ℓ ' 5000 (104), indicating that the cosmological gravitomagnetic eﬀect can be detected, if several foreground contaminations can be removed.},
